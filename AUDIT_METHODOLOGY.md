# WECA bus punctuality audit: methodology

An independent measurement of bus punctuality across the West of England,
built from operators' own public open data and compared against the published
95% punctuality target. It covers local registered bus operators in the WECA
area, not long-distance coaches or ferries. This document sets out how the
figures are produced and where they can be wrong.

## Data sources

Real-time positions come from the Department for Transport's Bus Open Data
Service (BODS) SIRI-VM feed, polled continuously and filtered to the WECA
boundary by point-in-polygon, not just a bounding box.

The timetable to measure against is built from three layered open sources,
because no single one is complete:

1. **BODS South West GTFS** for the bulk of all WECA operators.
2. **Operators' own BODS TransXChange**, to recover routes the GTFS conversion
   silently drops (the BODS GTFS is a lossy conversion that loses some complex
   routes day to day).
3. **The Traveline National Dataset (TNDS)** for routes operators run but do not
   publish to BODS at all (for example several First Bristol services). This is
   the same source bustimes.org falls back to.

All sources are publicly accessible: a free BODS API key and free TNDS access
are sufficient to pull the same data.

## Matching a vehicle to a scheduled trip

Operators' SIRI feeds label each vehicle with a `DatedVehicleJourneyRef` that is
usually the scheduled start time (HHMM), not a unique journey ID. So a live bus
is matched to a timetabled trip by: operator code, route, direction, first-stop
departure time (within 10 minutes), and the calendar day's service pattern.
Scoping the match to the vehicle's own operator resolves cases where different
operators or different parts of the region share a route number. This is a fuzzy
match, not a guaranteed one; where a confident match cannot be made, the reading
is dropped, not guessed.

## Where delay is measured

Delay is recorded at timing points - the registered points the punctuality
standard is based on - not at every stop. For each timing point on each day,
only the single reading where the bus passed physically closest to it is kept.
Only readings within 150 metres of the timing point count towards the published
figure; readings further out are stored but excluded, and the count and median
distance of those kept are reported. There is no interpolation and no assumed
speed: every figure is a real recorded position.

## On-time definition

A departure counts as on time if it is between 1 minute early and 5 minutes 59
seconds late (delay between -60 and +359 seconds). This is the DfT statistical
'on time' band, chosen because it matches the convention behind the official
published figures. The target is 95% on time, the figure in the West of England
Bus Service Improvement Plan and the Traffic Commissioner's window of tolerance.

## Geography (area and ward)

Each timing-point reading is tied to its stop's unitary authority (Bristol, Bath
& North East Somerset, South Gloucestershire, North Somerset) and electoral ward
using a stop-to-locality lookup, and rolled up so on-time performance can be
broken down by area and by ward. A ward's figure reflects only the stops
observed there, so sparsely-measured wards are treated as indicative.

## Fleet (model and electric)

Each reading carries the vehicle reference, which is matched against fleet data
from the [bustimes.org](https://bustimes.org/api/) API to get the vehicle make, model and fuel type. This drives the electric-vs-diesel split
and the per-model figures, including which service numbers each model runs.
Vehicles are assigned to routes operationally and change day to day, so by-model
punctuality is indicative of how a vehicle type performs on the work it happened
to do, not a verdict on the vehicle itself.

## Frequent services

A route is flagged frequent if it runs 6 or more buses in its busiest daytime
hour, the DfT high-frequency threshold. For frequent services the official
standard measures excess waiting time rather than timetable punctuality, so the
on-time figure shown for a frequent route is informative but not the basis on
which such services are formally judged.

## Coverage

Coverage is the share of scheduled trips we actually observed running on the
feed. It is a rough indicator only. A trip we did not see is not proof of a
cancellation: it may be a vehicle that was not broadcasting, a GPS dropout, or a
match we could not make. Coverage is reported as context, never as a count of
cancelled services.

## Limitations

- A bus absent from the feed is not the same as a bus that did not run.
- Positions are sampled roughly every 30 seconds, so the closest-approach reading
  is an approximation, not exact.
- The vehicle-to-trip match is fuzzy; where a confident match cannot be made the
  reading is dropped, not guessed.
- Only timing points are measured, which is the official basis, not every stop.
- Operators vary in feed quality; smaller operators tend to publish patchier data
  and are measured with less certainty.
- Early collection periods carry small samples, so per-route, per-area and
  per-operator figures can be volatile until enough days accumulate.
  Low-sample figures are flagged throughout.

## Scope and caveats

Operators are legally required under the Bus Services Act 2017 and the 2020
Open Data Regulations to publish timetable, vehicle-location and fares data.
Performance figures are not a statutory publication requirement. This audit does
not claim any operator is in breach of a publication duty. It is an independent
measurement: a public 95% target exists and the data to measure against it is
freely available, but no accessible, ongoing, route-level public record of actual
performance exists. These figures are independent estimates built to the official
definition and will differ from any operator or regulator measurement that uses
different sampling.
